[⚠️] Error converting timestamps: unconverted data remains when parsing with format "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S": "+00:00", at position 201. You might want to try:
    - passing `format` if your strings have a consistent format;
    - passing `format='ISO8601'` if your strings are all ISO8601 but not necessarily in exactly the same format;
    - passing `format='mixed'`, and the format will be inferred for each element individually. You might want to use `dayfirst` alongside this.
